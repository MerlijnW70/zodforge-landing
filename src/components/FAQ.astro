  {
    question: "How does the 7-day free trial work?",
    answer: "Start any paid plan (Pro or Enterprise) with zero payment upfront. You'll get full access for 7 days. If you don't cancel before the trial ends, your card will be charged. Cancel anytime during the trial with no fees."
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if I exceed my monthly request limit?",
    answer: "On the Free plan, requests stop at 100/month until the next billing cycle. On paid plans, you'll receive an email notification at 80% usage. Pro users can upgrade to Enterprise for unlimited requests, or contact support for a one-time limit increase."
  },
  {
    question: "How does the AI fallback system work?",
    answer: "Pro and Enterprise plans use OpenAI GPT-4 Turbo as the primary AI provider. If OpenAI is unavailable or slow (>5s), we automatically fallback to Anthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet. This dual-provider system ensures 99.99% uptime."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use ZodForge for commercial projects?",
    answer: "Absolutely! All plans (including Free) allow commercial use. Your generated schemas are yours to use without restrictions. We never store your schema data or API requests beyond 30 days for debugging purposes."
  },
  {
    question: "What programming languages do you support?",
    answer: "Currently, ZodForge specializes in TypeScript with Zod validation. The API returns fully typed TypeScript code. Support for other languages (JavaScript, Python with Pydantic, Go) is on our roadmap for Q2 2026."
  },
  {
    question: "How is my API key secured?",
    answer: "API keys are hashed using SHA-256 before storage. We never store plaintext keys in our database. Your key is sent only once via email after signup. If compromised, you can rotate your key from your dashboard (Enterprise) or contact support (Pro)."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer refunds?",
    answer: "Yes! We offer a 100% money-back guarantee within 30 days of your first payment. No questions asked. Just email support@zodforge.dev with your account email."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I cancel my subscription anytime?",
    answer: "Yes, cancel anytime from your account dashboard or by emailing support@zodforge.dev. Your plan remains active until the end of your billing period. No cancellation fees."
  },
  {
    question: "What's your average API response time?",
    answer: "Our average response time is under 2 seconds for schema refinement. This includes AI processing with OpenAI GPT-4 Turbo. Response times may vary based on schema complexity and AI provider load."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you provide technical support?",
    answer: "Free: Community support via GitHub Discussions. Pro: Priority email support (24-hour response time). Enterprise: Dedicated Slack channel with 4-hour response time during business hours (9am-5pm EST)."
  },
  {
    question: "Is my schema data private?",
    answer: "Yes. We only log request metadata (timestamp, success/failure) for billing and monitoring. Your actual schema code is never stored permanently. All data is transmitted over TLS 1.3 encryption."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I integrate ZodForge into my CI/CD pipeline?",
    answer: "Absolutely! Many customers use our API in their build pipelines. Check our documentation for examples with GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, and Jenkins. We recommend the Pro plan for CI/CD usage (5,000 requests/month)."
